## Setup & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git installed
- Ports 8001 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) available

### Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vtiwari-talentica/ci-cd-pipeline-health-dashboard.git
cd ci-cd-pipeline-health-dashboard
```

2. **Start the application stack**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Verify deployment**
```bash
# Check container health
docker-compose ps

# Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:5173
```

4. **Access the application**

5. **Test with sample data**
```bash
# Inject sample GitHub Actions build data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/ingest/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pipeline": "demo-pipeline",
    "repo": "my-org/my-repo",
    "branch": "main",
    "status": "success",
    "started_at": "2025-08-25T10:00:00Z",
