- Webhook-based data ingestion pattern

### Prompt 2: Detailed Technical Architecture
**Tool**: GPT-4  
**Prompt**:
```
Design a minimal FastAPI schema and endpoints to ingest CI build events and compute success/failure rate and average build duration over a time window. Include SQLite using SQLAlchemy and WebSockets for live refresh. Show me the database schema and API structure.
```

**AI Response**: Provided complete database schema with Build model, REST API endpoints for ingestion and metrics, WebSocket integration patterns.
