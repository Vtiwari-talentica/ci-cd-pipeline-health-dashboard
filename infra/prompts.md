## Specific AI Interactions

### 1. Security Configuration Generation

**Prompt to Copilot:**
```terraform
# Security Group for EC2 instances
resource "aws_security_group" "ec2" {
  name_prefix = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-ec2-"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  # Generate ingress rules for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and application ports
```

**AI Generated Security Rules:**
```terraform
  # HTTP from ALB
  ingress {
    from_port       = 80
    to_port         = 80
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  }

  # Application ports from ALB
  ingress {
    from_port       = 5173
    to_port         = 5173
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port       = 8001
    to_port         = 8001
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  }

  # SSH access
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = var.ssh_cidr_blocks
  }
```

### 2. Cloud-Init Script Generation

**Prompt to ChatGPT:**
```
Generate a comprehensive cloud-init script for Ubuntu 22.04 that:
1. Installs Docker and Docker Compose
2. Downloads the CI/CD dashboard application
3. Configures environment variables for database connection
4. Sets up systemd service for automatic startup
5. Configures log rotation
6. Implements health checking
7. Sets up CloudWatch agent for production environments
```

**AI Generated 200+ Line Cloud-Init Script** including:
- Automated package installation
- Docker configuration
- Application deployment
- Service management
- Monitoring setup

### 3. Deployment Script Automation

**Prompt for AWS Deployment Script:**
```bash
Create a comprehensive bash deployment script for AWS that:
- Checks prerequisites (AWS CLI, Terraform, SSH keys)
- Generates environment-specific Terraform variables
- Handles different environments (dev, staging, prod) with appropriate sizing
- Provides colored output and error handling
- Includes cleanup functionality
- Shows deployment summary with URLs
```

**Generated Features:**
- Prerequisite validation
- Environment-aware resource sizing
- Error handling with colored output
- Comprehensive help documentation
- Safe cleanup procedures

## Generated Code Examples

### 1. Environment-Aware Resource Sizing

**AI Generated Logic:**
```bash
get_instance_type() {
    case $ENVIRONMENT in
        prod)    echo "t3.large" ;;
        staging) echo "t3.medium" ;;
        *)       echo "t3.medium" ;;
    esac
}

get_db_instance_class() {
    case $ENVIRONMENT in
        prod)    echo "db.t3.small" ;;
        staging) echo "db.t3.micro" ;;
        *)       echo "db.t3.micro" ;;
    esac
}
```

### 2. Multi-Cloud Variable Standardization

**AWS Variables (AI Generated):**
```terraform
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t3.medium"
}
```

**GCP Variables (AI Generated):**
```terraform
variable "machine_type" {
  description = "GCE machine type"
  type        = string
  default     = "e2-medium"
}
```

**Azure Variables (AI Generated):**
```terraform
variable "vm_size" {
  description = "Azure VM size"
  type        = string
  default     = "Standard_B2s"
}
```

### 3. Auto-Scaling Configuration

**AI Generated AWS Auto-Scaling:**
```terraform
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "main" {
  name                = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-asg"
  vpc_zone_identifier = aws_subnet.public[*].id
  min_size            = var.min_instances
  max_size            = var.max_instances
  desired_capacity    = var.desired_instances
  target_group_arns   = [aws_lb_target_group.frontend.arn, aws_lb_target_group.backend.arn]
  health_check_type   = "ELB"
  health_check_grace_period = 300
```

## Prompting Strategies

### 1. Contextual Prompting

**Effective Pattern:**
```

Specific Request: "Generate AWS RDS configuration with security best practices"
Requirements: "Include encryption, backup policies, multi-AZ for production"
Format: "Terraform HCL with comments explaining security choices"
```

### 2. Iterative Refinement

**Initial Prompt:**
```
Generate basic AWS VPC with public and private subnets
```

**Refinement Prompt:**
```
Enhance the VPC configuration with:
- Multiple availability zones for high availability
- NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
- VPC Flow Logs for security monitoring
- Proper route table associations
```

### 3. Cross-Platform Consistency

**Standardization Prompt:**
```
Create equivalent GCP networking configuration that matches the AWS VPC design:
- Similar subnet CIDR ranges
- Equivalent security controls
- Same architectural patterns
- Consistent naming conventions
```

## Quality Assurance

### AI-Assisted Code Review

**Prompt for Code Review:**
```
Review this Terraform configuration for:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Best practices compliance
3. Cost optimization opportunities
4. High availability considerations
